=head1 NAME

DBD::Informix::TechSupport - Obtaining Technical Support for DBD::Informix

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use DBD::Informix::TechSupport;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes how to obtain technical support for
IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12)
(which is also known as DBD::Informix).
It also describes how to use the Perl module to report information to
any of technical support channels.

=head1 IBM INFORMIX TECHNICAL SUPPORT

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12)
is not officially supported by IBM Informix Technical Support.
If you are using a supported configuration, they will route problem
reports to the maintenance team listed below.

This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler <dbd.informix@gmail.com>.
You may also report your bugs via the CPAN resolution tracking system:

    http://rt.cpan.org/

Such bug reports can be sent by email to <bug-DBD-Informix@rt.cpan.org>
they also get sent to dbd.informix@gmail.com, etc.

Under normal circumstances, you will receive a response (but not
necessarily a solution) by the end of the next working day (California
time, California holiday schedule).

=head1 OTHER SUPPORT

The mailing list for Perl DBI and DBD::Informix is dbi-users@perl.org.
For information on how to subscribe to (and unsubscribe from) the dbi-users
mailing list, send a message to dbi-users-help@perl.org.
You could also consider using the news groups comp.lang.perl.modules (for
Perl and DBI) and comp.databases.informix (for DBD::Informix).
These channels may provide quicker support, especially over holiday
weekends.

=head1 CONFIGURATIONS SUPPORTED

We normally only support IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12)
if you are using certain supported versions of ESQL/C or Client SDK:

=over 2

=item *

Client SDK Version 3.00 (ESQL/C 3.00) or later

=back

You may use Perl Version 5.6.1, but you should ideally be using Perl
Version 5.14.0 or a later, stable version of Perl.

You must be using DBI Version 1.38 or later.

If you are using some other version of ESQL/C, or some other version
of Perl or DBI, you must use the other support channels documented
above.

=head1 OTHER CONFIGURATIONS WHICH PROBABLY WORK

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12) is believed to work with all versions of ESQL/C and ClientSDK
from ESQL/C 5.00.UC1 upwards.
However, you may run into problems with shared libraries if you use
versions of ESQL/C which are not explicitly supported.
This is sometimes because of problems with the way ESQL/C handles
either its own shared libraries or other (system) libraries.
If you run into such problems, you can consider editing the library
list (see the fix_hpux_syslibs and fix_aix_netstub functions in
Makefile.PL for illustrations), or you can build a statically linked
Perl executable (see Notes/static.build).

It is known that versions of ESQL/C earlier than 5.00.UC1 will not
work; if you cannot upgrade from ESQL/C 4.x, then consider using
DBD::Informix4, also obtainable from CPAN.

At various times, DBD::Informix has been tested with both OnLine and
SE at most versions from 5.00 upwards.

DBD::Informix will probably work with most versions of Perl from
5.006001 upwards (subject to using an appropriate version of DBI), but
you should aim to use 5.14.x until there is a later stable version available.

DBD::Informix currently requires DBI v1.38; it will not accept earlier
versions.  You should be using at least DBI v1.616.

=head1 USING THE DBD::Informix::TechSupport Module

The script InformixTechSupport illustrates how to use the various
functions described here.

=head2 Using bug_report

The Notes/bug.report file describes in detail the various classes of
bug report (A, B, C or D).
You specify the bug class and optionally (for a class D bug) a list of
tests to run.

	bug_report("A");

	bug_report("D", @test_list);

You should trap both the standard output and standard error output
into a file and use that as the basis of your bug report.
You will also need to describe the symptoms of any detailed failure
you have if the tests pass.
Although you would often use the distributed tests, you can substitute
your own test provided you include the source code with the bug report
and it is cribbed from one the distributed tests.

The bug_report function reconfigures DBD::Informix (all classes), then
builds it (classes B, C, D) and tests it (classes C, D).

=head2 Using it_works

This generates the information needed for a report that you have managed
to get IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12) working.

	it_works;

=head2 Using print_versions

This function is called with a string containing the names of the
items for which you need the version.

	print_versions("Perl DBI DBD::Informix ESQL/C");

The valid items are:

=over 2

=item *

Perl

=item *

DBI

=item *

DBD::Informix
