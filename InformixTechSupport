=head1 NAME

InformixTechSupport - Technical Support tool for IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<InformixTechSupport -V>

C<InformixTechSupport -v [ Perl | DBI | DBD::Informix | ESQL/C ]>

C<InformixTechSupport -b [ABCD] [test ...]>

C<InformixTechSupport -w>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The InformixTechSupport script is used for a variety of purposes
related to technical support of IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12).

=head2 CHECKING SOFTWARE VERSIONS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -V> to discover the version number of each
of the components listed in the next section.

=head2 CHECKING VERSIONS OF SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -v component> to discover the version number
of a component used by DBD::Informix.

The valid component names are:

=over 2

=item *

Perl

=item *

DBI

=item *

DBD::Informix

=item *

ESQL/C

=back

Other component names are silently ignored.

=head2 CREATING A BUG REPORT

Use C<InformixTechSupport -b [class] [tests ...]> to create a basic
bug report.
The file Notes/bug.reports contains detailed information about the
classes of bug reports (which are A, B, C, and D).
If you have a class D bug, then you can list the specific test(s)
which are failing on the command line.

The output contains most of the information that will be needed to
debug your problem.
If your problem is not with the standard tests, then you should aim to
create a standalone reproduction of your problem and include that test
with your bug report.

=head2 CREATING A REPORT THAT IT WORKS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -w> to create a report that IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12) works.
You may need to edit the output; you may certainly add comments in the
'Optional comments' section.
The output is written to standard output only.
It is never sent anywhere unless you actually choose to send it.

If you do send the report, please put "DBD::Informix - It Works" in the
subject line and send the report to C<dbdinfmx@us.ibm.com> (this is a
change of email address from the instructions in the 1.00.PC2 version of
DBD::Informix).
