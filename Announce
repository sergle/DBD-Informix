Subject: ANNOUNCE: IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12) released

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl 5.6.1 or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (but if you are not already using Perl
5.10.0 - or any later version - you should be planning to upgrade to
Perl 5.14.0 or later).  You will need the code for DBI version 1.38 or
later as well (v1.616 - or any later version - is recommended).  The
code for DBD::Informix is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build this module, use the ItWorks (Perl)
** script to report your configuration to the maintenance team (meaning
** Jonathan Leffler) at dbd.informix@gmail.com.
** The ItWorks script does not send email to anybody; you have to do
** that yourself.

New in release :PRODVER::
* Minor bug fix release.
* Main change is related to Perl internals and avoids the need for
  PERL_POLLUTE.  This change is not visible to users except that Perl
  5.14.x can use the fixed code.
* Fixed problem with string that is not null terminated by ESQL/C library.
* Clean up some 64-bit compilation warnings.
* Build on AIX.
* Evade problem with a DISTINCT type of LVARCHAR with NOT NULL (probably
  ESQL/C bug).
* Fewer versions of Informix products are supported.  You may try
  building DBD::Informix with other versions.  If it works, great; if
  not, please upgrade to a supported Informix version.

New in release 2008.0513:
* Fix $sth->{TYPE}: return 9 (SQL_DATE) not -1 (SQL_LVARCHAR), fixing an
  11-year old bug.
* Add support for BIGINT in ESQL/C 3.50, including $h->{ix_bigserial}.
* CPAN Testers reporting issues because Makefile.PL not exiting
  successfully when pre-requisites not met.
* ESQL/C 3.50 (for IDS 11.50) typedefs ifx_loc_t - update dumpesql.h to
  cope (Joe R Plugge <jrplugge@west.com>).
* ESQL/C test fails during configuration when $Config{ccflags} has
  leading spaces.  Records show this problem also affected Dr Guenther
  Seifert <guenther-h.seifert@t-systems.com> in June 2007.  Apologies
  for not getting it fixed sooner.

Support email address:
* This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler <dbd.informix@gmail.com>.
* You may also report your bugs via the CPAN resolution tracking system:
    http://rt.cpan.org/
* Such bug reports can be sent by email to bug-DBD-Informix@rt.cpan.org;
  they also get sent to dbd.informix@gmail.com, etc.

As always, see the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
