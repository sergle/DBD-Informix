I gave an answer too, but Jason's answer is the most complete to date.
I've edited Jason's answer for this document.  I've also removed all the
'>' prefixes, so you cannot actually tell what Jason wrote and what I
edited.  Thanks, Jason.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the esqltest program gives you error -27000, you will need to alter your
database environment to be able to build (more strictly, to test)
DBD::Informix.  As of version 0.95, you should not see the -27000 error
message; you will see an assertion that you are using two shared memory
connections and you will be notified that the multiple connection tests
will be skipped.  If you want to test multiple connections, you need to
follow the information in this note.

The Informix finderr utility says:

    -27000  Cannot support multiple connections over shared memory.

    An application cannot use the CONNECT statement to make more than one
    connection that uses shared-memory communication (IPC).

    Ensure that the application makes only one shared-memory connection at
    a time. If the application must use concurrent connections, the OnLine
    administrator might need to change the connection type (as specified in
    the nettype field of the sqlhosts file) from a shared memory
    connection to a network connection.

Basically, it means what it says.  You can't use shared memory for multiple
connections.  So you have a couple of options on how to connect.  You will
have to use one non-olipcshm (eg network) connection rather than (or as
well as) the shared memory connection.

To do that you may need to change the entry for your server
($INFORMIXSERVER) in your sqlhosts file ($INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts by
default, unless you set $INFORMIXSQLHOSTS to point to a different file).
Currently yours probably looks something like this:

# db server     connection      host                    service name
#               type

ifmx_online     onipcshm        Taz                     xyz

Either change the onipcshm (or olipcshm) entry to oltlitcp, or add a couple
of lines to it, one for the network connection (oltlitcp) and one for a
streams connection (olipcstr).  Something like this:

ifmx_online_tcp ontlitcp        Taz                     ifmx_online_tcp
ifmx_online_str onipcstr        Taz                     ifmx_online_str

The db server and service name can be anything you like, but should be
systematically related.  You can also use a streamed pipe connection which
is faster than tcp/ip but a bit slower than shared memory.  Plus, it saves
you a step because you don't have to list the service name in
/etc/services.  This allows me to connect via shared memory, stream pipes
and tcp/ip.  The service name is not used (ignored) with this connection
type.

Then you'll need to add your network service name to /etc/services (or the
NIS or YP equivalent of it) if it is not already present, and you'll need
to add the new dbservers to the aliases section of your onconfig file
($INFORMIXDIR/etc/$ONCONFIG).  It'll look something like this:

DBSERVERNAME    ifmx_online     # Name of default database server
DBSERVERALIASES ifmx_online_str, infm_online_tcp

Remember to add the db server name to onconfig.  After all that you'll need
to restart the db server.  This obviously needs cooperation from your
OnLine DBA, but doing "onmode -ky; oninit" takes only a few seconds if the
database is idle.

Then, when you are building DBD::Informix be sure to set your environment
variables correctly (you have read the README file, haven't you?).
Specifically your db name needs to be db@ifmx_online_str or
db@ifmx_online_tcp.  You can also set $INFORMIXSERVER to one of the aliases
and just use the db name without the server name.

Note that you can still use one shared memory connection; you just can't
use two shared memory connections simulataneously.  Therefore, only one of
the databases needs to be qualified with a non-olipcshm server name.  It
would be 100% legitimate to use DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE=stores with
INFORMIXSERVER=ifmx_online (the olipcshm connection) and to have
DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE2=stores@ifmx_online_tcp.

Note that you can set the INFORMIXSQLHOSTS environment variable to point to
the (absolute) name of the sqlhosts file you want to use.  This might allow
you to have a local SE as well as your DBA's OnLine system:

ifmx_online	olipcshm	machine	sqlexec
local_se	seipcpip	machine	sqlexec

Note that the two sqlexec fields have different meanings.  The OnLine entry
indicates the service name in /etc/services (or NIS/YP equivalents).  The
SE entry indicates the name of the program in $INFORMIXDIR/lib (unless
specified as a full pathname, I think) that is to be run; sqlexec is the
name of the SE 'server' program, of course.  You could then use SE to
create a local database and use that.  This assumes you have both OnLine
and SE on your machine.

1999-11-27:
Note that if you really cannot get away from the using shared memory
connections, then (as of version 0.95) you no longer have to modify
anything.  The esqltest program will report that you are using two shared
memory connections and that the multiple connection tests will be skipped.
The actual multiple connection tests attempt to detect the use of two
shared memory connections before making either connection, and skip the test
if both connections will use shared memory.  The multiple connection tests
are t/t2[123]mconn.t.  Note that the code that identifies shared memory
connections may fail (especially on NT) and therefore the multiple
connection tests may still fail.  If this happens and the cause of failure
is error -27000, then you can ignore the failures (and if everything else
passes, you can install the product).
