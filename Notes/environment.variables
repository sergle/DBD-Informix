Key Environment Variables for IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2011.0612 (2011-06-12)

There are many possible environment variables which affect Informix
software and therefore which affect DBD::Informix.  All of the ones
mentioned here are also documented in the Informix documentation (usually
the Informix Guide to SQL: Reference manual for the version of the software
that you are using).  You should be able to obtain this documentation from
the Informix web site http://www.informix.com/answers.

Major Environment Variables
---------------------------

INFORMIXSERVER
    This must be set with 6.00 and later versions of Informix ESQL/C (and
    all versions of ClientSDK, therefore).  Even if no other Informix
    variable is set, this one must be.  This is mandated by the products
    used by DBD::Informix, so it is also required by DBD::Informix.
    Further, the server referenced by it must be available; things are apt
    to fail, but take a very long time (many seconds) over doing so, if the
    server is missing.

INFORMIXDIR
    When building DBD::Informix, this must be set, even if the value is is
    the default of /usr/informix (I'm discussing Unix primarily!).  When
    running, you can get away without this environment variable being set,
    because the process which creates Informix.pm records the value of
    $INFORMIXDIR used at compile time.  It is still a good idea, in
    general, to set it explicitly in the environment.

PATH
    Usually, you will need $INFORMIXDIR/bin on your PATH to find other
    Informix executable programs.  When building DBD::Informix, it is
    mandatory that it is on your PATH.  At runtime, you could get away
    without having it on your PATH provided that you use an explicit
    pathname to identify any executable found in $INFORMIXDIR/bin.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    Also known as SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX and LIBPATH on AIX.  If you are using
    shared libraries, you may need to set this when you build your
    executable.  The versions of DBD::Informix from 0.95 onwards arrange
    for the shared libraries to be identified by full pathname rather than
    by the abbreviated (relative) name, so new versions of DBD::Informix
    won't need LD_LIBRARY_PATH set unless you compiled DBD::Informix with
    the DBD_INFORMIX_RELOCATABLE_INFORMIXDIR environment variable set.

Minor Environment Variables
---------------------------

INFORMIXSQLHOSTS
    The name of the sqlhosts file if it is not $INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts

SQLEXEC
    Only of relevance to version 5.x versions of ESQL/C.  The name of the
    server executable.  You might need to know about SQLRM and SQLRMDIR,
    which give an alternative method of identifying the server.

ONCONFIG
    TBCONFIG in version 5.x OnLine.  The configuration file for the server.
    Seldom needed with 7.x and later systems.

DBDATE
    Controls format of date variables on output, and assumed format on
    input.

DBMONEY
DBFORMAT
    Should control format of MONEY values (and, arguably, DECIMAL and FLOAT
    and SMALLFLOAT values) when converted to a string.  However,
    DBD::Informix leaves FLOAT and SMALLFLOAT values as C doubles, and
    ignores it for DECIMAL and MONEY types.

INFORMIXCONRETRY
INFORMIXCONTIME
    You might need to have these set on some systems.  Such systems are
    most likely to be Windows 95/98/NT client machines connecting to a
    remote server.  I've never needed them on Unix; I'm not sure whether
    they work on Unix.

CLIENT_LOCALE
SERVER_LOCALE
DB_LOCALE
DBLANG
GL_DATE
GL_TIME
GL_*
LANG
LC_ALL
LC_COLLATE
LC_DATE
LC_MESSAGES
LC_MONETARY
LC_NUMERIC
    These are environment variables which collectively control the locale
    in which the DBD::Informix software works.

DBD::Informix Environment Variables
-----------------------------------

All these environment variables apply strictly to the build and test
phases of making DBD::Informix.  They are of no relevance when running
DBD::Informix unless you've modified something.

DBD_INFORMIX_AIX_USENETSTUB
    By default, ClientSDK 2.01.UC1 (ESQL/C 9.15) on AIX 4.2 includes
    -lnetstub on the link line.  The library $INFORMIXDIR/lib/libnetstub.so
    is not acceptable to the loader (for reasons which are not clear; not
    permissions, and the 'file' command doesn't suggest any differences),
    so the linking fails.  The simplest workaround seems to be to use
    libnetstubshr.a instead.  The code in Makefile.PL detects it is on AIX
    (but does not distinguish the version number) and edits the reference
    to this library, warning you that it has done so and referencing these
    environment variables in the message.  The variables must be set to any
    non-false value (so 'yes' is a good value to use).  Using environment
    variables to fix the infelicities of the ESQL/C script is in vogue.

DBD_INFORMIX_AUXILLIARY_OBJECT_FILES
    A list of other object files to include in the Perl shared library.

DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE
    The primary test database.  You need DBA permissions on this
    database.  It does not matter which logging mode you use, but a
    logged database (buffered, unbuffered or MODE ANSI) gives better
    test coverage.

DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE2
    The secondary test database.  You need CONNECT permissions on this
    database.  It does not matter which logging mode you use, but a
    different logging mode from the primary test database is
    recommended.

DBD_INFORMIX_DATABASE3
    The tertiary test database.  You need CONNECT permissions on this
    database.  Although it does not matter which logging you use, it
    exists to allow the t/t51getinfo.t tests to validate the third
    distinct logging mode (unlogged, logged, MODE ANSI) in a single test
    run.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_CONNATTR
    Set to debug the handling of connection attributes.  Seldom set by
    users.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_ESQLCC
    Set to debug what the esqlcc script is doing.  Seldom set by users.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_ESQLLD
    Set to debug what the esqlld script is doing.  Seldom set by users.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_ESQLTEST
    Set to see the compilation for the esqltest program.  Seldom set by
    users.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_GCC
    Set to get extra flags (-Wall -pedantic -Wno-comment) passed to GCC.
    Primarily for the maintenance team.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_LIBDETECTION
    Set to force the use of code to detect the list of ESQL/C libraries,
    usually needed on machines like HP-UX or AIX where the C compiler is
    not used to create the executable.  Seldom set by users.

DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_LIBMAP
    Set to see the mapping of relative shared library names (-lifgen) into
    absolute names ($INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql/libifgen.so).  Seldom set by
    users.

DBD_INFORMIX_ENABLE_ASSERT
    Set to include assertions in the code.  Seldom set by users.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLCC_REMOVE_OPTIONS_REGEX
    Parallel to DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_REMOVE_OPTIONS_REGEX.  If set, any
    arguments which match this option are removed from the command line
    generated by ESQLCC.  Note that this always prints out the regex used.
    If you have DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_ESQLCC set too, then you also see the
    'before' and 'after' lists of arguments.  The regex is enclosed inside
    percent symbols instead of slashes (you might use slashes inside the
    regex).  It can be helpful to set it to '^-KPIC$' to remove complaints
    from GCC on Solaris 7 when using the c4gl script instead of esql -- set
    it in DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_REMOVE_OPTIONS_REGEX too.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLC_LINKAGE
    Set to -shared or -static to force a particular linkage mechanism.
    Seldom set by users.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_NO_G_OPTION
    Remove -g option from linker command line when requested, based on a
    problem found by Brad Huan-Ming Kao <proton@iiidns.iii.org.tw> on SCO
    3.2v5.0.2.

By the time you're using any of the ESQLLD remove or replace environment
variables that follow, it is usually better to think about hacking (a
copy of) the esql script itself.  However, each has had its uses.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_REMOVE_OPTIONS_REGEX
    Generalization of DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_NO_G_OPTION; if it is set, any
    arguments which match this option are removed from the command line
    generated by ESQLLD.  Note that this always prints out the regex used.
    If you have DBD_INFORMIX_DEBUG_ESQLLD set too, then you also see the
    'before' and 'after' lists of arguments.  The regex is enclosed inside
    percent symbols instead of slashes (you might use slashes inside the
    regex).  Note, you can set it to "^-l(c|aio|elf)$" to see what happens
    when you omit the C, AIO and ELF libraries from the command line; my
    experience is that everything still works OK.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_REMOVE_OPTION_PAIRS
    Another generalization of DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_NO_G_OPTION; if it
    set, then any multi-word options which match this regex are removed.
    It might be set to the value '-z\s*(combreloc|ignore|lazyload)\b' on
    Solaris to avoid shared library loading problems with versions of
    Perl built to use the '-z ignore' option, etc.  Note that the name
    is a misnomer; it maps the options into a single string, removes all
    text matching the regular expression, and then resplits the string
    into options separated by blanks.  Note too that it could be used in
    place of either of the other options mentioned.  Do not use it if
    there are pathnames with blanks in them - or, better, do not use
    pathnames with blanks in them.

DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_REPLACE_OPTIONS_REGEX
    And another generalization of DBD_INFORMIX_ESQLLD_NO_G_OPTION; ever
    get the feeling that linking causes problems?  Used, for example, to
    map -xarch=sparcv9 to -m64.  The value should be a Perl substitute
    operator such as "s/^-xarch=sparcv9$/-m64/".  It operates on single
    arguments; it is painful to devise a mechanism that substitutes
    multiple of these things.

DBD_INFORMIX_HPUX_USELIBV3
DBD_INFORMIX_HPUX_USELIBCL
    By default, ClientSDK 2.40.HC1 (ESQL/C 9.30) on HP-UX 11.0 includes
    two libraries which are counter-productive.  The more serious
    problems are caused by '-lcl' and '-l:libcl.1', which contains some
    thread-local storage that causes the testing phase to fail.  The
    less serious problem is '-lV3' which doesn't seem to provide any
    symbols to the linking.  The code in Makefile.PL detects it is on
    HP-UX (but does not distinguish the version number) and deletes the
    references to those libraries, warning you that it has done so and
    referencing these environment variables in the message.  The
    variables must be set to any non-false value (so 'yes' is a good
    value to use).  If you get a link failure or a runtime failure with
    missing symbols, you could try setting these environment variables.
    These libraries are also included on HP-UX 10.20, but don't seem to
    spoil things there -- but they can equally well be removed.

DBD_INFORMIX_NO_DBCREATE
    On some Informix systems, permission to create databases is not
    given to all and sundry.  This is a good thing for security, but
    makes it harder to test some parts of DBD::Informix.  If you do not
    have database create permission, set this environment variable to
    any non-zero (Perl 'TRUE') value.  (Note that this is independent of
    DBD_INFORMIX_NO_RESOURCE permission.)

DBD_INFORMIX_NO_ESQLTEST
    Suppress the esqltest phase of the checking.  Do not attempt to
    report build errors if you have this value set in your environment.

DBD_INFORMIX_NO_RESOURCE
    Sometimes, a user without DBA or RESOURCE privileges will need to
    install DBD::Informix.  Setting this environment variable will tell
    the DBD::Informix test suite to avoid tests that need DBA or
    RESOURCE privileges.  All tests that are run will use temporary
    tables only, and will avoid creating stored procedures, and so on.

DBD_INFORMIX_NO_SBSPACE
    Suppress the testing of smart blobs (BLOB and CLOB).  Use it if you
    have an IDS 9.x server but no smart blob spaces.  See also
    DBD_INFORMIX_SBSPACE.

DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD
    Password for connection to primary test database.

DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD2
    Password for connection to secondary test database.  Defaults to
    DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD.

DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD3
    Password for connection to tertiary test database.  Defaults to
    DBD_INFORMIX_PASSWORD2.

DBD_INFORMIX_RELOCATABLE_INFORMIXDIR
    Set if the shared libraries should be linked specifying relative
    library names (-L$INFORMIXDIR/lib -lname) rather than absolute path
    names ($INFORMIXDIR/lib/libname.so).

    This allows you to build DBD::Informix for Perl on Machine A and
    install it on Machine B which has $INFORMIXDIR in a different
    location, or to use DBD::Informix with multiple different values of
    $INFORMIXDIR all on Machine A.  The downside of setting it is that
    root-privileged processes (and some SUID processes) may not work,
    and you need to ensure that the correct value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
    its many equivalents (SHLIB_PATH, /etc/ld.so.conf, ...) are set
    appropriately.  Recommendation: use the default fixed location of
    $INFORMIXDIR if you possibly can.

DBD_INFORMIX_SBSPACE
    This specifies the name of the smart blob space that will be used when
    creating smart blobs in during the tests, and defaults to "sbspace".

DBD_INFORMIX_SERVER
    Obsolete.

DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME
    Username for connection to primary test database.

DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME2
    Username for connection to secondary test database.  Defaults to
    DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME.

DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME3
    Username for connection to tertiary test database.  Defaults to
    DBD_INFORMIX_USERNAME2.

DBD_INFORMIX_USE_EPRINTF_CODE
    If you run into problems with GCC and missing symbol eprintf
    (possibly with one or two leading underscore characters), then set
    this to use the supplied alternative eprintf.c code.  It is much
    better to avoid setting this.
