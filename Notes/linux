This file contains some miscellaneous (and non-comprehensive) notes on
using Perl and DBD::Informix with Linux.  The messages are prefixed with a
line like --#1#-- (search pattern /^--#[0-9]*#--/).

Quick Guidelines:
*   It may be easier to use your own version of Perl than the
    distributed version (ditto for Apache if you want to extend it).
*   Not all versions of Linux ESQL/C work on all versions of all
    distributions of Linux.
*   The -lcrypt library had to be added to the esql script for early
    (7.24.UC5) versions of ESQL/C on some distributions (RedHat 5.2).

Actually, the compile of esqlbasic.ec also fails, pointing out that the problem
is in the ESQL/C system, and also that you're working on RedHat or some other
glibc distribution.  You're right, it can be fixed.  The best way to do it is
to fix the esql script for the machine -- it's what I do.  And you're right,
I need to put together some Linux hint material, including this and a patch
to the esql script.

There is another little trap in building DBD-Informix-0.60: If you do a
'perl Makefile.pl' on linux references to crypt(3) are undefined. Thus
the test of the environment fails an no Makefile is generated. I added a
'-lcrypt' to Makefile.pl which is apparently inelegant but works. A hint
in the README file would be helpful.

Subject: [FYI: Buggy Perl in Redhat 5.2!]

Jonathan,
I'm forwarding a copy of the message I posted to redhat NG. The Perl
version bundled with Redhat 5.2 is buggy. The Majordomo folks have
pointed this out in their FAQ:

	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~barr/majordomo-faq.html#4.13

You might wish to make a note of this bug in DBD::Informix README file
(that is if you find time!). But it will be really helpful for lot of
folks.

Subject: Buggy Perl in Redhat 5.2!

This might be a well known fact by now, but let me repeat it as it may
save someone a lot of time and frustration. I tried compiling
DBD::Informix on a Redhat 5.2 box (with Perl 5.004_04) and guess what? I
spent hours tweaking DBD::Informix (Informix driver for DBI perl module)
without any results. Everything worked fine after I upgraded my Perl.
Then I looked if anyone else had similar problem and bumped into
majordomo FAQ which clearly spells out this problem. So upgrade your
Perl folks, if haven't already. I guess subscribing to Redhat's Bugzilla
is not such a bad idea.
