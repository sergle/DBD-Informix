DBD::Informix Examples Directory
================================

The scripts in this directory illustrate the use of Perl DBI with the
DBD::Informix driver.  The scripts generally assume that there's either a
stores or a stores7 database available, that you have DBA privileges on
that database, and that additions to both the set of tables and the data in
the standard tables are permitted.  The scripts do not drop or alter tables
they do not create, nor do they delete or update data they did not insert.

Note that the scripts assume /usr/bin/perl is your Perl interpreter.  If
this is not correct, either run the scripts with 'perl xNNexample.pl' or
use the fixin.pl script from the 1st Edition of the Camel book (there's a
version as amended by me in this directory).

Extra examples will be welcomed; please use one of the existing examples
as a template, and ensure that your name and email address are included in
the comments (rather than, or as well as, mine).
